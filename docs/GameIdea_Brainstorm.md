# Game Jam Theme: Timeless

## Platformer game loop replayer
The player needs to solve a pussle and get to the finish, but to get there you usually need to do things that needs more then 1 character to play.
to solve this, the player can play a game loop and then go back to the start of the loop, now the player can play it all over again alongside the playthough that the player just took the first time, this way, the player may stand on its head to jump to higher places or grab things that usually are time sensative.

## Watch time rewind
The player can look at something unfold but its happening backwards, as time is rewinding.
The player needs to figure out what happened.

## Time out of place
A game where things are out of place of its own time and need to be orginised.
This could be done with an event playing with situations not suited for that time 
or a still frame of objects where the objects seem to be misplaced in its general time group.
