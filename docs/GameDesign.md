# Platform RePlayer

### Brainstorm origin

#### Platformer game loop replayer
The player needs to solve a pussle and get to the finish, but to get there you usually need to do things that needs more then 1 character to play.
to solve this, the player can play a game loop and then go back to the start of the loop, now the player can play it all over again alongside the playthough that the player just took the first time, this way, the player may stand on its head to jump to higher places or grab things that usually are time sensative.


# Description

A 2D platformer puzzle game where you have to overcome challenges that seem to make more sense with multiple players... the catch?;
You may record an entire game loop, and then rewind to the start to do it all over again, but this time, the first game loop you just played will be replayed as if there were a second player playing with you at the same time doing the exact same movements that you were doing on the first playthrough.
