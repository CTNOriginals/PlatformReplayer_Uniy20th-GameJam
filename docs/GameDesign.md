# Platform RePlayer

### Brainstorm origin

#### Platformer game loop replayer
The player needs to solve a pussle and get to the finish, but to get there you usually need to do things that needs more then 1 character to play.
to solve this, the player can play a game loop and then go back to the start of the loop, now the player can play it all over again alongside the playthough that the player just took the first time, this way, the player may stand on its head to jump to higher places or grab things that usually are time sensative.


# Description

A 2D platformer puzzle game where one player has to ovecome challanges that seem to make more sense with multiple players, the catch?; The player may records an entire game loop, and then rewind to the start to do it all over again, but the next time, the first game loop will be replayed as if there were a seccond player playing with him at that time doing the exact same movements that the player did on the first playthrough.
